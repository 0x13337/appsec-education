## Training Decks

In this directory you'll find PDF and PowerPoint versions of two internal presentations developed and presented by our Application Security team:

- Introduction to Application Security
- Advanced Application Security

Each of these presentations include content covering a wide range of application security topics, common vulnerabilities and remediation recommendations.

## Hunter2 Labs

As a part of this public release of our content, we've also included the code and content for our custom Hunter2 labs. [Hunter2](https://hunter2.com) is a platform specifically designed to help users gain application security knowledge through hands-on labs, identifying issues and fixing vulnerabilities.

These lessons have been made available on the Hunter2 platform a part of a collaboration between the Hunter2 service and Duo Security. More information about it can be found on the Hunter2 site: [https://hunter2.com/community](https://hunter2.com/community)
