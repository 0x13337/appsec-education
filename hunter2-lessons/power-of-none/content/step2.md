## Expected Functionality

There are several pieces of functionality that are included in our application. These are:

- User registration
- Logging in
- The ability to enter the second-factor code provided to complete the login

The issue weâ€™ll be investigating relates to the third one on the list - the code entry. There may be other issues that you run across in the normal usage of the application, but those are secondary to this.

### To continue

For now, click on the "Login" menu item at the top of the page and then click "register now" to register a new user. The registration form will error if both fields are not filled in but has no other restrictions. When you complete the user registration, you will be able to continue.
