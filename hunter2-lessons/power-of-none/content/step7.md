## A Possible Solution

While there are several potential ways to fix the code, we wanted to update the `secureCompare` function so we could be sure the same check is performed everywhere it is used. Below is an example of one way to correct the problem. 

It performs validation on the input and ensures that both values are strings before continuing to the length validation. In order to check this, we make use of Python’s “isinstance” function and the list of string types from the Six compatibility library.

The new `secureCompare` function then looks like this with the changes:

```
def secureCompare(input1, input2):
   if not isinstance(input1, six.string_types):
       return False

   if not isinstance(input2, six.string_types):
       return False

   bytes1 = bytearray(str(input1), 'utf-8')
   bytes2 = bytearray(str(input2), 'utf-8')

   if len(bytes1) != len(bytes2):
      return False
   
   result = 0
   for x, y in zip(bytes1, bytes2):
      result |= x ^ y

   return result == 0
```

The two `isinstance` checks ensure the two input values are both strings. Now if you try and submit the form with no value for the “code” field, the comparison fails. This is because the code we added is doing additional type checking to ensure that the values in `input1` and `input2` are actually string values.
