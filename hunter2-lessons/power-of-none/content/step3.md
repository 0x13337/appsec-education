## Testing the Login

When you log in to the application from the `/user/login` page, you'll be given a success message and then forwarded to the next page. On that next page there'll be a form that requires that code to complete the login. This code is randomly generated and is uniquely assigned to the user currently logging in.

On the second page, you'll enter both the username you're trying to log in and the code that was provided previously.

### To continue

Try logging in now with the user you just created. When the first part of the login is successful, you'll be given the code and a button to click on to proceed. The code is automatically copied to your clipboard so you can just click the button to continue. When the second form comes up, enter your user's username and paste in the code you were given. Since they match, you'll be given a "success" message.
