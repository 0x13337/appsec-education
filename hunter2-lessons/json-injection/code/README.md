# Lab: JSON Injection

## Outline

- Define what JSON is and how it relates to Javascript including 
    -> common uses
    -> example of a JSON document (`pico data/users.json`)

- Cover some of the best practices around JSON (???)
    -> most of the issues come from incorrect parsing
    -> then the vector could be used in another attack

- Performing the attack
    -> viewing the page, noticing the use of `eval` in JSON parsing
    -> viewing the JSON endpoint (notice how the values are output)
    -> adding and editing users, trying different vectors in the `username` and `email` fields
    ----
    -> perform a custom POST request with the `id` value as something other than an integer
        like `alert('xss')`

Issues:
    - invalid input validation on the "ID" parameter
    - poor JSON parsing via `eval`
    - bad output escaping practices setting the value in the table
    


-------------
Remember, all (most?) JSON is valid Javascript

Reflected/DOM injection
Stored injection

how is eval involved?

What about JSONP? Too much?

Using third party libraries to correctly parse the JSON and prevent injection and execution (like jQuery)
