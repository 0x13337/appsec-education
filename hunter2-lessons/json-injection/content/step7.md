# Summary

In this lesson we've walked through a vulnerability that could be introduced to your application through poor JSON content handling and how to correct it. Our application contained several flaws that allowed an XSS attack to be performed:

- Improper JSON document creation using a custom handler
- Improper JSON parsing using a custom parser
- Use of `eval` in the Javascript JSON handling allowing for code execution

In each lesson you learned how to correct each of these issues and migrate over to use built-in JSON functionality to replace the "roll your own" version with major flaws. Take this knowledge back to your own applications and ensure that it's not suffering from similar issues and harden your JSON handling to prevent issues in the future.
